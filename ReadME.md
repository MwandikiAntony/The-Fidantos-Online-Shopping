## Project Description
This is a multipage e-commerce website that includes several pages: Home, About, Contact, and more. The website uses HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to provide a modern and interactive shopping experience.

## Pages Included:
- Home Page: The landing page with featured products and a navigation bar for easy access to other pages.
- About Page: A page to provide information about the Fidantos Shopping Center.
- Contact Page: A form where users can reach out with inquiries or support questions.
Features
- Responsive Design: The website adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- Contact Form: A form that allows users to send messages with their name, email, and message. It includes form validation for user inputs.
- Interactive Elements: Hover effects, smooth scrolling, and visual transitions enhance the overall user experience.
- Footer with Contact Information: Includes address, phone numbers, and social media links.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5: Semantic HTML used for structuring the content.
- CSS3: Custom CSS styles and media queries for responsive design.
- JavaScript: Added interactivity, such as form validation and smooth scrolling effects.
- Icons: Font Awesome for social media and other icons.

## Design Choices
- Layout: The layout follows a clean and modern minimalistic approach, focusing on ease of navigation and visual hierarchy. The home page features large product images and clear call-to-action buttons to encourage users to explore more.
- Color Scheme: A modern color palette with neutral background colors and contrasting accent colors for call-to-action buttons and links. This enhances readability and provides visual appeal.
- Typography: Simple and legible fonts for better accessibility, with varying sizes for headers and body text to create a clear visual hierarchy.

## JavaScript Functionality
- Form Validation: JavaScript is used to validate the contact form fields. It ensures that the user provides a name, email, and message before submitting the form.
- Smooth Scrolling: Implemented smooth scrolling on the page to create a more fluid navigation experience.
- Event Listeners: JavaScript event listeners are used for handling form submissions and button hover effects.
Challenges Faced
- Responsive Design: Ensuring that the website worked well on both large and small screens was challenging, especially with images that needed to resize accordingly. I used CSS media queries to solve this issue.
- Form Validation: Initially, the form wasn't validating properly across all browsers. I fixed this by improving the event listeners and testing the form on multiple devices.
- Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensuring that the website looked consistent across all browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) was a challenge, but by using vendor prefixes and testing thoroughly, I was able to ensure compatibility.
